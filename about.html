            I’m an enthusiastic IT student with a strong interest in web
            development, content management, and problem-solving. Over the past
            few years, I’ve gained hands-on experience working with platforms
            like WordPress, October CMS, and Laravel, while also developing
            skills in testing, technical support, and database management. I
            enjoy creating practical, user-friendly solutions and continuously
            learning new technologies to improve my work.<br /><br />
            Outside of work and studies, I like to keep a balance by staying
            active. In my free time, I work on personal projects, explore new
            ideas in web development, and enjoy lifting weights, swimming, and
            climbing. These activities help me stay disciplined, focused, and
            creative—qualities I bring into both my professional and personal
            life.
